__LexManos__: Alright, it's officially 3 o' clock.

__cpw__: It is! Hello! Good evening, everyone. Welcome to.. a big FAP party! This is the Forge Parley event for 2018; we might try and do this again if this one goes alright. <br>
I'm cpw, sometime Forge developer. And joining me in chat, we have LexManos who you probably all know-

__LexManos__: Hello everyone.

__cpw__: Sorry Lex, I talked over you.

__LexManos__: I was just saying hello.

__cpw__: We also have mezz, who is also a big contributor to Forge these days.

__mezz__: Hello, this is mezz.

__cpw__: And Tamas is hanging out in the background; he's been a long-time co-...pal of Forge. We hope to have some other people joining us later on, we'll see what happens. But right now, I'll switch the screen back to this _(screen switches to FAP18 logo)_, we'll go back to the code in a wee while. <br>
This was just mostly setup to give us a chance to talk to you about what's happening with Forge in 2018. It's become a very very big and public project over the last... 7 years now Lex, isn't it? Seven I think, yeah, 7.

__LexManos__: Somewhere around there.

__cpw__: _(chuckles)_ It's come from, like-

__LexManos__: Way too old for this.

__cpw__: Yeah, this whole thing is just completely nuts. But y'know, everyone is- Forge is very old, very old indeed, and a lot of what we're going to be talking about is related to that age. <br>
Forge was designed - and FML, the piece that I've been working on for the last long while, was designed in... 1.2.3? When Bukkit was still big, ModLoader was still _the_ standard for building mods and so we had to be 100% compatible with ModLoader. Java 1.6 was fresh and new, and we had to be compatible with Java 5. Spritesheets was still a thing. <br>
So, this was very, very different world back in those days, and the... technical debt has been huge. We've accumulated cruft from the time that ModLoader died back in 1.6.4, the time Bukkit died. Y'know, we've got code that still does stuff from before we split out the classloader and gave that to the Mojang team.

__LexManos__: We've got code that has existed before the client and server were merged together.

__cpw__: Yes, yes we do. That's right, that was the first big thing we did. _(chuckles)_ Dealing with that client and server merge, that was a whole world of fun. So, yeah. <br>
For the last, I'm-a say the last two years, I've been on a mission to try and clean up the mess. Originally, I'd hoped to target 1.12; that was a very, very na√Øve hope, which was a year ago by the way - 1.12 came out a year ago now. I was hoping to target 1.12 with this work, but there was no way it was ever going to be ready in time, so we deferred it. And 1.13 has taken a very long time to come out. As we all know, it's still not gonna be out, probably for another, another 2 or 3 weeks maybe? And so, we've taken this opportunity to redo a lot of how mods load. <br>
_[sees a message from Grum\_]_ Yes, yes it is Grum. Hey Grum, hello! _(laughs)_

__LexManos__: Is that actually Grum, or is that some fake...

__cpw__: I believe that is actually Grum. Do you want an invite into the voice? _(brief moment of silence)_ <br>
Yeah, that's actually Grum.

__LexManos__: Let's have the account in question verify that they are not a fake account.

__cpw__: "oh god please not" _[from Grum\_]_, he doesn't actually want to go on voice anyway, so that's fine. "Only a fake grum would say hes the real grum" _[from The_CodedOne]_.

__mezz__: Yeah, we should try to get a fake Grum in chat.

__cpw__: _Hang on a minute... yeah that's no one I care about._ We can get an easy verification from Grum. _[keyboard clacking]_ <br>
I've put a request in, Grum, you know where to answer it. _(moment of silence)_

__LexManos__: Cuz if that it the real Grum, toss him a moderation thing.

__cpw__: That's what I was gonna do, I was gonna mod him.

__LexManos__: I love you all in channel, but I prefer- I like to filter people out based off on icons cuz there's a lot of people.

__cpw__: "2 kittens" _[from Grum\_]_, yes indeed , that's right. Yes indeed. Ah, yeah, there you go. _(laughs)_ Fine, whatever. How do I give you moderation... _ban, timeout, mod user!_ There we go, he's now a mod. Alright, _(clears throat)_ you did. Let's carry on talking about what's going on. Do do do..., where's that bloomin' list of questions, cuz I think that's probably a good place to start, wouldn't you agree?

__LexManos__: Yup, that's why we had them collate it.

__cpw__: Yeah, indeed. _Yeah, that's good... that one! Okay, so if I do this... [screen switches to list of questions]_ We have a list of question, yay! _We'll do that... Don't need to see that!_ <br>
So, we've been asking for questions on, _(chuckles)_ on Discord for the last week; this is a collation of obvious questions from there, and myself and the others will go attempt to answer them while on the stream. Then hopefully once we've got these answered, if we can throw it open for more questions 'cause no doubt there'll be more. I will be showing a little bit of what the new mod system looks like; it's not complete, the status is still very much... yeah, there's still a lot to be done to get it to same state as we had in 1.12, but I'm confident that we can deliver that fairly shortly. Yeah, looks like we can mark it all. <br>

> **1.13 General**: What's the progress on 1.13?

__cpw__: So, "What's the progress?" _[from the questions]_. We still have a lot of work to do... I have- We have agreed that we're going to be merging in all of the functional changes from my branch of FML, which means we are completely redoing the mod loader, we are completely redoing how mods load, and we are completely redoing probably some of the network stuff as well. We'll talk about that a little bit more later, but that's still being in discussion, so... There's still a lot of work to be done but I'm confident that we can get it going, I think we've crossed all the big serious hurdles to making it all work, which is the key. Do you have anything to add, Lex?

__LexManos__: So, for those who don't know, basically Forge is two different projects, well, three different projects. There is the LaunchWrapper, which was donated to Mojang; it's what allows their old versions to work on their new launcher. It's also what runs all the coremods and all that stuff. There's FML, which is the basic mod loader that just loads a class file, fires off a couple events saying 'Hey, the client loaded'; and then there's Forge, which is all of the actual modifications to Minecraft, adding new events, changing how- basically all the registries, all the big library stuff, is Forge. <br>
So, cpw has to comment on this, but as far as 1.13 is concerned, because we're updating to support Java 9 which everyone has been craving for, and so much is changing in 1.13, he's completely rewriting LaunchWrapper, and that's the fundamental thing-

__cpw__: FML as well. So, FML is mostly rewritten, it's restructured- there's still a lot of common code, but a large amount of the methodology that FML uses to load mods has changed as we've gotten more and more-

__LexManos__: Your mic's doing it again. _[referring to buzzing from cpw's mic]_

__cpw__: _Oh... [mic cuts out briefly, comes back clear] better?_ As we've got more and more understanding about how FML works and how people have been using it, building these giant modpacks, we've realized that one of the big problems is the way that FML loads mods. It's all single stream at the moment, and one mod goes after another all the way through, and if like you have 250 mods and each one takes 1 second to execute one of the events, we have 5 events that they can receive, that means that they take 5 seconds each to load; 250 times 5, that's 750 seconds, that's over 10 minutes. _(chuckles)_

__LexManos__: One of the major complaints people have is just the load time, and there will never be a day Forge loads a thousand mods instantaneously-

__cpw__: No.

__LexManos__: -because stuff needs [to be] actually processed, but we're working on making it faster without the technical debt we've acrued from ModLoader. A lot of the issues is because ModLoader.

__cpw__: Yeah, a lot of it is technical debt that we carried over from ModLoader, which is annoying, but that's why- _["250 * 5 is not 750" from offbeathwitch]_ and yeah, you're right, it's not 750, it's 1250, so it's actually way worse than that, that's 20 minutes, isn't it? _(chuckles)_ You can blame ModLoader, ModLoader is from a different era. That's the reality of the situation. Modding was just different; people weren't building as many huge mods, they were the exception rather than the rule. _["a different eta... like 7+ years ago" from ohaiiChun]_ Yes, it was 7 years ago, iChun. <br>
Anyway, so there is progress; there has a huge amount of progress. I'm confident that we can deliver something; it's gonna be a- gonna be a lot of work between now and "Wow, 1.13 is wonderful and stable and I love it!", but, yeah. I'm fairly certain it will probably be 1.14 before we really are at that point... but, yeah.

> **1.13 General**: Have you faced any difficulties with 1.13?

__cpw__: "Any difficulties with 1.13?" Yeah, we've rewritten the entire modloading framework from the point that the launcher calls it all the way through to running the game, so yeah, that's quite a lot of difficulties. I know Lex has been doing a lot of work on the backend tooling as well, I think because we're very cognizant that Java 9, Java 10, Java 11 are all coming; they're all out, 9 and 10 are out there now, 11's due in 3 months time-

__LexManos__: Mic. _[referring to buzzing from cpw's mic]_

__cpw__: _[mic briefly cuts out, comes back clear]_ Sorry. _(chuckles briefly)_ 11's due in 3 months time, that just means we are gonna have a, y'know, we got to make sure that everything is able to deal with all of this. 11 may well have the first ground of Valhalla work, which we'll talk about a bit more later on, but y'know, there's a lot of big things coming in the pipeline and we've gotta... we've gotta try and deal with this now, so we're taking this now. _[deep breath]_ Okay.

> **1.13 General**: Is there any progress towards Java 9 and 10 supprort? If so will it be compatible with Java 8? Will there be support for the Java Module system?

__LexManos__: So there's one question, second from bottom of that section related to Java 9 and 10-

__cpw__: Yeah.

__LexManos__: So, we are a Minecraft modding system. We need to be compatible with what Minecraft is compatible with. So, we have to support whatever versions of Java that Minecraft supports. So for now, for the forseeable future, that's Java 8 and above. If you wanna have Forge designed and require Java 10 or Java 11 with the new Valhalla stuff, go yell at Mojang.

__cpw__: Yep. So, I'm just going to expand on that a little bit. I don't know - Grum might want to chime in here in a second - so currently, what I've done, and one of the reasons, one of the strong motivators for why we rewrote this stuff, was that Java 9, Java 10 are out there, they break a lot of about what- is- how modding works in 1.12 today, so we had to rewrite it. Everything I have done, as far as I can tell, is compatible with Java 9 and 10. They are not yet compatible with the Module system. <br>
That is a thing on my roadmap to support, that will be a fairly significant change when we do switch over to supporting it, 'cause I think there is every likelihood that mods will want to use the Module system to expose APIs and stuff like that, but unfortunately I have had to kill off a couple of features from FML to make sure that in Java 9 and Java 10 world, modding still works. <br>
One of the key ones -- and this is going to be an annoyance for a lot of people -- is you can't all ship the same bloody packages anymore, 'cause that just does not work in Java 9 and 10, okay? So, I know that the tradition was -- it's not really as much anymore -- but, back in the old days y'know, every mod had it's copy of the RF library in it, for example. That just breaks horribly in Java 9 and up. So we can't do that.

> **Education and Communication** <br>
> What can we do to further Educate about the following subjects: <br>
> New or Improved Features, such as Jar in Jar dependencies
> (**partial answer**)(?)

__LexManos__: So, uh, a comment on that: if people have been paying attention to Forge, one of the major features that was just rolled out in the last couple updates was a complete rewrite of the library management system - you know the whole jar-in-jar thing? So, from an end-user point of view, you can still ship the APIs and everything, it'll just be a single JAR download. You just gotta lay it out correctly and Forge will take care of the rest.

__cpw__: _["The library managemend system is another question!" [sic] from JTK222]_ It is another question JTK, I know. We'll talk about that a little bit more a little bit later on, but that's gonna change a little bit for 1.13; I've got a couple of neat tricks that I can do with the new 1.13 stuff that we can't do in 1.12. <br>
API stuff is gone, yeah. @Optional, API, both of those hacks are gone, they can't work in the new world, so I've just killed it. So, it's an annoyance but it's the reality, we have to be compatible with the future so I have to kill features that just can't work in it.

__cpw__: _["Is that ASMData table still around? I do love magic annotations?" from modmuss50]_ ASMData table? Yes, it's still around, it's changed its name but it's still there, you can still do magic annotations. IMC's gonna get an overhaul as well. I'm gonna convert that to a pure supplier system, so no more "Oh, can you please support random objects and stuff?" Yeah, that's just gonna be gone; IMC's gonna be: "Here's a queue of people with suppliers. Call them all or whatever you want to do with them." _(chuckles)_ So, IMC's gonna be a lot more simple, but a lot more functional that it was today. So...

__cpw__: _["So if nothing else changes, Ender Io would suddently have dependencies on about 30 mods..." from HenryLoenwind]_ Yes and no, Henry. You've gotta realize the difference between- _["re Optional" from HenryLoenwind]_ -yeah I know @Optional is gonna be a pain in the neck to deal with. But, we have to kill it, it doesn't work. When you go into Java 9, it is just broken. It is just gonna completely break, and we know Java 9 is gonna land soon.

__LexManos__: So, in all actuality, if those 30 mods used the capability system, used our event busses, use the features that Forge provides, then it can all always be soft dependencies. There should be no reason that you have to have a hard dependency on an optional mod.

__cpw__: Yep, so dependencies themselves are gonna change a little bit with 1.13 as well because- I'll talk about that a little bit later on. Let's just start pushing through some of these questions quickly, 'cause we've sort of talked through them.

> **1.13 General**: ETA on 1.13 Stable Forge?

__cpw__: "An ETA on Stable?" _(chuckles)_ We'll let you know when we've got any idea, I think.

__LexManos__: So basic roadmap -- you can't hold me to this because things will change -- is within a week or two of 1.13 officially dropping, I would like to have a compilable version of Forge, which is just the modloader and boots into Minecraft. But the plan is to completely audit every single hook and every single feature of Forge to see if it's even needed anymore, and if it is, rewrite it in a better way. So, we're talking months here. Just to be flat out honest, we're talking months for it to be back up and running full-bore.

__cpw__: _["Is this the despacito2 announcement stream?" from GamingDeeDoubleYous]_ _(chuckles)_ No, this isn't the Despacito 2 announcement stream. So, okay...

> **1.13 General**: Do you expect this to be the last big rewrite forge will ever need?

__cpw__: I hope so. Uh, I hope that, I really hope that this is it. I've tried-

__???__: Here's to seven more years though.

__cpw__: _(chuckles)_ I agree.

__LexManos__: Honestly, if we can get another seven years out of this rewrite, and then we need another one because Java has changed so fricking much, I'm okay with that.

__cpw__: I'm pretty sure Java's not going to change that much. The only big thing that's likely to change us significantly from now on out is Valhalla, because value types are gonna change a fair bit about how stuff works -- for the good, I mean they're not gonna be a bad thing. But that shouldn't require a rewrite of how Forge loads. Modules? When we adopt module system stuff, that's gonna change how mods load because APIs and stuff will be available then again, and you know there might be things like multi-version JARs that we can support and other tricks like that. We'll see -- I've got to do a real sanity check on that, I haven't focused on that yet.
